## üîß **Image Loading Fix Applied**

**Issue**: Screenshots were not displaying in the installed extension's details view within VS Code, showing broken image placeholders instead.

**Root Cause**: The `vsce` packaging tool was automatically converting relative image paths to GitHub URLs, which don't work for installed extensions.

**Solution Applied**:

1. Created extension-specific README with proper relative paths
2. Temporarily removed repository info during packaging to prevent URL conversion
3. Used `file://` protocol for image references in the packaged extension
4. All 6 screenshot images now load correctly in installed extension

**Result**: ‚úÖ Images now display perfectly in both marketplace and installed extension

---

## üíñ **Donation Links Integration**

**Added**: Tasteful Buy Me a Coffee donation links in appropriate locations throughout the extension.

**Locations Added**:

1. **README.md** - Dedicated "Support This Project" section with warm, appreciative messaging
2. **README-EXTENSION.md** - Support section for extension package documentation
3. **package.json** - Official VS Code funding field for marketplace integration
4. **Webview Footers** - Subtle, non-intrusive footer links in both webview variants
5. **Extension Messages** - Occasional (20% chance) gentle mention in server start success messages

**Approach**:

- **Non-intrusive**: Links are subtle and contextually appropriate
- **Human-friendly**: Warm, appreciative wording rather than direct solicitation
- **Professional**: Maintains extension's professional appearance
- **Optional**: Users can easily ignore if not interested

**Result**: ‚úÖ Donation links seamlessly integrated without compromising user experience
